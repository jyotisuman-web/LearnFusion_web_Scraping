<h>Web scraping<h1> <h3>is the automated process of extracting data from websites. It's commonly used in data analysis, market research, competitive analysis, and more.</h3>
<h4>How It Works:</h4>
<li>
<p>A script (usually written in Python with libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium) sends a request to a webpage.</p>

<p>The webpage returns HTML content.</p>

<p>The script parses the HTML and extracts the needed data (e.g., tables, product prices, reviews, headlines).</p>
</li>
